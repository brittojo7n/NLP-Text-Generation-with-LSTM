# NLP Text Generation with LSTM 🧠✍️

A neural network that learns from Wikipedia articles and generates natural language text using an LSTM-based architecture.

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Scrape structured text from Wikipedia using `wikipedia-api`
- Preprocess and tokenize text sequences
- Train an LSTM neural network to predict and generate text
- Generate sentence continuations from a user-provided seed phrase

It's a compact example of practical NLP using sequence modeling.
